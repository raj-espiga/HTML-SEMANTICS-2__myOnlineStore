                            <h3>Canon EOS 5D Mark IV</h3>
                            <p>The EOS 5D Mark IV tweaks and improves on almost everything before it, with a 30.4MP sensor and advanced 61-point AF system, together with 4K video recording - all of which performed well in our real-world tests. With a 5D Mark V successor essentially ruled out by Canon, the Mark IV will continue to be one of the most compelling DSLRs at this price point.</p>
                            <p>4K video options are a little limited, with the frame-rate topping out at 30fps and no options to shoot in a flat gamma profile. But if you're mainly looking for a powerful DSLR for stills photography, the EOS 5D Mark IV remains a surprisingly modern proposition, considering its age - and the fact that you can still buy it new is a testament to its popularity. </p>
